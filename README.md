Facebook Look Alike
--------------------

Commands to run the app:
1. npm install
2. npm start

Open http://localhost:3000/ in browser

--------------------
Assumptions
--------------------

1. Every data is hardcoded and its a static page. No dynamic data
2. Since Facebook sidebars has too many data , it makes no sense of showing it on Menu in Mobile devices. 
   It can be shown as a seprate page by clicking on a menu icon on the mobile device (not implemented)
3. Used only Bootstrap and React components.
